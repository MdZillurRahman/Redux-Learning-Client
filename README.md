#### Usage 



Developers need documentation in order to define, clarify, or advise users on the technology. For individuals attempting to implement Redux features or using Redux for the first time, the documentation will be useful. The "Redux Learning" project will assist new web developers in learning about Redux. In addition to learning, a developer can register and take the topic's final quiz. Developers will benefit mentally from being able to assess their progress while taking the quiz.



**The new technology that we will use in this project is:** `Redux`



#### Why Redux?
Redux provides a subscription mechanism that any other code can use. It is most helpful when used in conjunction with a declarative view implementation, such as React or another similar library, that can infer UI updates from state changes.
We selected Redux since it is a free Javascript library that allows for the centralization of application state management.
